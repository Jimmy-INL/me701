<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>SciPy offers way more than we could cover in a single lesson (or even several). Here, a handful of neat applications are reviewed that span a wide range of technical areas.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://scipy.org/">SciPy</a> project provides a lot of documentation and support.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/">SciPy Cookbook</a> is a great resource for copy/paste/adapt/(and cite!) solutions for many problems.</p>

<p>This lecture was conducted by Rabab, and the goal was to explore a Jupyter notebook with problems related to numerical errors, linear systems (dense and sparse), and SciPy applications (various curve fits and solving an ODE). This notebook is homework 4.</p>
