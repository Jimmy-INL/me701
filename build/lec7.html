<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>By the end of this lesson, you should be able to demonstrate the basic, collaborative development cycle using <code>git</code> and GitHub (or similar repository-hosting systems). Along the way, you will work with a partner to complete part of the next homework.</p>
<!--

## Learning Outcomes

  - Students will be able to employ command-line tools to create, access, and
    modify remote software repositories.

  - Students will be able to write succinct messages for the repository
    log that describe source-code modifications.

  - Students will be able to select an appropriate collaborative workflow.


## Essential Questions

  - How can I use a `git` repository that lives on another server?

  - How can my friend and I work on the same repository at the same time?

  - What is a `branch` and a `fork`?

<p>The <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a> book is freely available and provides just about all one needs to dive into <code>git</code> for the first time.</p>
<p>Atlassian provides this <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet">nice git cheat sheet</a></p>
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students will clone, modify, and push changes to a remote repository.</li>
<li>Students will fork, clone, modify, push changes to and create a pull request for a remote repository.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>

<ul>
<li>Don’t forget that you need <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> before <code>git push</code></li>
<li>Students should review pull requests by others; maybe a formal assignment of who does what would be good</li>
<li>Live tasks edited above to reflect what we actually did!</li>
