<h1 id="working-with-python">Working with Python</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this lesson, we get up to speed with Python and how to use it on our machines from both the terminal (WSL or otherwise) and graphical options. We’ll also look at some of the variable types in Python.</p>
<!--


## Learning Outcomes

 - Students will demonstrate how to run a Python program in both 
   Windows and WSL.
 - Students will demonstrate that they can install appropriate 
   language extensions.
 


## Essential Questions

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>The recommended Python framework is <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>, which comes with everything we will need by default for this part of the course.</p>
<p>A fairly representative set of topics is provided by my old ME 400 notes <a href="https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/index.html">Python for Engineers</a>.</p>
<p>Other resources for Python include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Downey, Think Python; <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/">free to download</a>; This is an introductory text that has been used in ME 400 previously. Use it as a reference for basic programming logic and Python syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>H. Langtangen. <em>Python Scripting for Computational Science</em>, 3rd ed. Springer, (2009). ISBN: 978-3540739159 This is an older, somewhat outdated text. However, I like it because it shows how versatile Python can be and where it entered into the technical computing domain.</p></li>
<li><p>B. Shapiro. <em>Scientific Computation: Python Hacking for Math Junkies</em>. Sherwood Forest Books, (2015). ISBN: 978-0692366936. This book is just fun. Each chapter is pretty focused on some math, computational, or similar, technical problem.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students will be able to select and install an appropriate version of Python and related packages.</li>
<li>Students will write and execute a simple program in Python.</li>
<li>Students will use Python as a “graphing calculator” to compute and visualize results for simple problems.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<h3 id="before-lecture">Before Lecture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Review lectures 1 through 11 of <a href="https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/index.html">Python for Engineers</a>. Most of this should be <em>review</em> given the prerequisites for this class, but I may include some content there that less familiar.</li>
<li>Put together a list of the programming topics that is least familiar, most anxiety-inducing, etc. I want to focus on the weakest links in the time we have with Python.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="during-lecture">During Lecture</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Check that Python is available from Windows and/or the WSL terminal.</li>
<li>Interactive Python exercises (using, e.g., IDLE in <code>bash</code>)</li>
<li>Scripted Python exercises (using, e.g., VS Code or Spyder)</li>
</ol>
