<h1 id="branches-remotes-and-conflicts">Branches, Remotes, and Conflicts</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We’ll continue with our survey of <code>git</code> and GitHub with a focus now on navigating local and remote branches. As we get further into collaborative work (including with ourselves!), <em>merge conflicts</em> will arise, and we’ll see how to handle them.</p>
<!--

## Learning Outcomes

  - Students will be able to create, update, and push branches.

  - Students will be able to define remote repository locations and
    fetch/push updates from/to those repositories.

  - Students will be able to recognize avoidable merge conflicts and
    resolve unavoidable merge conflicts


## Essential Questions

      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?

  - What happens if my friend and I both make a pull request into the
    same remote branch?

  - How can make a development branch on my computer and have it show up
    on GitHub?

  - What is the difference between `branch`, `clone`, and `fork`?
