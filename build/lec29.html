<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>For some applications, it <em>may</em> be easier to sketch out designs using a “what you see is what you get” interface like Qt Designer. Windows, layouts, widgets, and more can be dragged and dropped, and the starter code (in C++ or, for us, in Python) is automatically generated. Of course, slots and signals are largely left to the user to define (as might be expected).</p>
