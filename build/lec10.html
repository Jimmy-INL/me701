<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We’ll dive into using Python for routine calculations and analysis common to engineering course work and related applications. For this type of work, the Spyder IDE is a great choice (and is good for Python work in general). We’ll also look at use of Jupyter notebooks for integrating written analysis with computed results.</p>

<h2 id="evidence-of-student-learning">Evidence of Student Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students will clone a remote repository, make a new branch, and push changes in that branch to the remote</li>
<li>Students will explain how to fix a merge conflict.</li>
<li>Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="required-preparation">Required Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The recommended Python framework is <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>, which comes with everything we will need by default for this part of the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>A fairly representative set of topics is provided by my old ME 400 notes <a href="https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/index.html">Python for Engineers</a>.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual-d">Install Anaconda</a> as our WSL Linux distribution of choice. In the WSL terminal, execute</p>
<p><code>wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh</code></p>
<p>Mac OS folks can do</p>
<p><code>wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-MacOSX-x86_64.sh</code></p>
<p>When downloaded, everyone can run the script by executing <code>bash Ana...x86_64.sh</code>. (Fill in the file name.) This takes some time! Choose <code>yes</code> for all options unless you know better.</p></li>
<li><p>Open VS Code. Does it find Anaconda?</p></li>
<li><p>Open Spyder. Play with arrays and plots.</p></li>
<li><p>Open Jupyter. To work, a browser is needed, so, e.g., <code>sudo apt install firefox</code>. Brief survey of Markdown mixed with code.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Display issues took up lots of time.</li>
<li>Ran into some issues getting Spyder to load properly. It seems a handful of machines needed <code>sudo apt install libxss1 libegl1-mesa</code> to get missing <code>libXss.so</code> and <code>libEGL.so</code> into place. Without seeing the machines, this could be an actually missing library or it could be a location/naming/linking error. Neither issue is something I can easily debug without hands-on access to the machines in question.</li>
