<h2 id="learning-plan">Learning Plan</h2>
<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview

<li>Go over the <a href="https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/Basic_Data_Processing_with_NumPy_and_Matplotlib.html">Lecture 3</a> and <a href="https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/More_on_NumPy_Arrays.html">Lecture 4</a> notes from ME 400 on Matplotlib (and NumPy)</li>
<li>Skim the examples at the <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/index.html">Matplotlib Gallery</a></li>
<li>Read this short <a href="https://storybydata.medium.com/edward-tufte-data-visualization-pioneer-e70eb3a8e2f0">article</a> about Edward Tufte</li>
<li>Learn about <a href="https://bids.github.io/colormap/">colormaps</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have to point out this Coursera course: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting">Applied Plotting, Charting &amp; Data Representation in Python</a>. It’s basically the course I’m trying to distill into a single module! Two good videos for <em>this</em> lecture are these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/lecture/python-plotting/graphical-heuristics-data-ink-ratio-edward-tufte-qFnP9">Data-Ink Ratio</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/lecture/python-plotting/graphical-heuristics-chart-junk-edward-tufte-LCcy7">Chart Junk</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They are super short, so watch them!</p>
