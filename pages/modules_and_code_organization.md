# Modules and Code Organization

## Summary

Organizing Python code in functions and files leads to importable *modules* that help
us to glue together more complex programs.

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html


##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will clone a sample repository with a predefined module.
  - Students will import and use a module from a variety of locations.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


## Learning Plan

### Before Lecture

  - Review all of the material specified for `The Structure of Python Programs` (our last lesson).  Although I didn't cover this material explicitly in our lessons, the content is thoroughly presented in several videos I've used for ME 400.  I *assume* it's mostly review, but please let me know if anything I cover is way beyond what you saw in your ME 400 experience.

  - Read [Modules and Packages](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/Modules_and_Packages.html).

  - Skim this [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) 
  

### During Lecture

  1. Clone example repository.
  2. Examine the modules.
  3. Explore how to use (external) modules in code 
   
### After Lecture

 - [Lecture, Fall, 2021](https://mediasite.k-state.edu/mediasite/Play/575bff66045f4937a21917226293c6ac1d)
