# Static Viz with Matplotlib

## Summary

In this lesson, we illustrate a few different ways that Matplotlib can 
be used to show data statically.  Although good practice is applied, the 
intent here is to focus on the various tools provided by Matplotlib.


## Resources

Probably the best resource to use is the 
[Matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/index.html).


##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will create 1-D and 2-D plots using Matplotlib.
  - Students will read and write numerical and other data from file 
    and select those data to be plotted.
  - Students will report their learning in their logs.


## Learning Plan

### Required Preparation

 - Go over the [Lecture 3](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/Basic_Data_Processing_with_NumPy_and_Matplotlib.html) and [Lecture 4](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/More_on_NumPy_Arrays.html) notes from ME 400 on Matplotlib (and NumPy)
 - Skim the examples at the [Matplotlib Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/index.html)


### Live Activities

  1. Get the data to work with.
  2. Go over trajectory example.  Show that sometimes data modeling
     is needed for effective visualization.
  3. Go over pandemic example.  Show that things like statistical
     spread are easy to highlight using effective color and transparency
     channels.
