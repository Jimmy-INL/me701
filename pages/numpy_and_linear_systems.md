# NumPy and Linear Systems

## Summary


NumPy (short for numerical Python) is the core component for just about
all technical computing done with Python.  In this lesson, we examine
its basic components with a focus on arrays and linear systems.  


## Resources


The [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) project provides a lot of documentation and
support, including [this introductory tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html).


##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will install (if needed) and import NumPy.
  - Students will construct NumPy arrays to represent vector quantities.
  - Students will construct NumPy arrays to represent matrix quantities.
  - Students will use NumPy to solve linear systems of the form $\mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}$.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

## Learning Plan

### Before Lecture

  - Review [linear systems](http://robertsj.github.io/python_for_engineers/courses/pythonic_apps_2/modules/module_2/module_2.html).
  - Review [least squares](http://robertsj.github.io/python_for_engineers/courses/pythonic_apps_2/modules/module_3/least_squares.html)

### During Lecture 
  
  1. Review basic array operations.
  1. Set up a linear system using NumPy arrays for a small heat-conduction problem.
     We will use this open-source [example code](https://www.menards.com/main/hardware/fasteners-connectors/washers-spacers/flat-washers/grip-fast-reg-1-2-grade-2-zinc-flat-washer-8-count/232-1172/p-1444451969003-c-8945.htm?tid=-4976779743945285105&ipos=3)
  2. Discuss (and show!) the challenges of systems when they become very large.

   (Note, much of the supplement may feel a bit advanced.  Don't worry.  I just want you to be able to set up
   linear systems for your applications using NumPy.)
