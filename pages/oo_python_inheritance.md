# More on OOP in Python

## Summary

More details related to inheritance and abstract interfaces are
illustrated.  

## Resources

The online textbook [Object-Oriented Programming in Python](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io)
is a pretty good resource for Python and, in particular, it provides a suitable
level of supporting information for object-oriented programming.


##  Evidence of Student Learning


  - Students will identify the four features of object-oriented programming
    in various examples.
  - Students will create a simple class hierarchy.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

## Learning Plan
