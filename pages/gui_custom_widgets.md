# PyQt and Custom Widgets

## Summary

Students will learn how to interactively paint on a `QPixmap` and
to use the resulting data to infer information about a background
canvas image.

## Resources

Martin Fitzpatrick, *Create GUI Applications with Python & Qt5*.

Alan Moore, *Mastering GUI programming with Python*. 

##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will implement elements of a "plot digitizer"

## Learning Plan


### Before Lecture

  - Review MF Chapters 29 and 30

### During Lecture

  0. Clone (or pull) the [sample code](https://github.com/me701/gui_2d_graphics.git) for this lesson.
  1. Follow the `README.me` 

### After Lecture

   - [Video, Lecture, 11/12/2021](https://mediasite.k-state.edu/mediasite/Play/4f0f24ab29ee4765b950276990cd75171d)  

   - Dive into the Chapter 30 example.  We don't have time for it in class but it's a pretty nice and compact
     example of how one can create very different versions of things that already exist conceptually (e.g.,
     the `PowerBar` meter is really like a `ProgressBar` with less resolution (but maybe more flair!)))
