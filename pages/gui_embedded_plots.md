# Embedding Plots in PyQt Applications

## Summary

Students will explore ways to incorporate 2-D plots into their
applications.

## Resources

Martin Fitzpatrick, *Create GUI APplications with Python & Qt5*.

Alan Moore, *Mastering GUO programming with Python*. 

##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will produce a working "graphing" application. 

## Learning Plan


### Before Lecture

  - Review Chapters 35 and 36 of Fitzpatrick. 

### During Lecture

  0. Clone the [sample code](https://github.com/me701/gui_embedded_plots.git) for this lesson.
  1. Review the GUI code and run as is.
  2. Incorporate the Matplotlib-based widget.  (You may wish to have the book available!)
  3. Implement the PyQtGraph-based widget.  (This may not work well for us:
     `conda install -c conda-forge pyqtgraph` takes some time....)


### After Lecture

   - [Video, Lecture, 11/08/2021](https://mediasite.k-state.edu/mediasite/Play/705fb96fc8204d85bdb52f6a984180671d)  

### Jeremy's Notes

  - Beyond these two options, Moore's book (ch 16) discusses use of Qt Graph,
    which gives lower-level access to the Qt's methods, etc.

  - This is the first time having the full Anaconda distribution may be 
    a real drag (Qt Developer was a pain, too, though.)  Ugh.
