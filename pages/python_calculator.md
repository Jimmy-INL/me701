# Python as a Calculator                                                      

## Summary

We'll dive into using Python for routine calculations and analysis
common to engineering course work and related applications.  For this
type of work, the Spyder IDE is a great choice (and is good for
Python work in general).  We'll also look at use of Jupyter notebooks
for integrating written analysis with computed results.

##  Evidence of Student Learning


  - Students will clone a remote repository, make a new branch, and push
    changes in that branch to the remote
  - Students will explain how to fix a merge conflict.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


## Learning Plan


### Required Preparation

  - The recommended Python framework is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual),
which comes with everything we will need by default for this part of the
course.  

A fairly representative set of topics is provided by my old
ME 400 notes [Python for Engineers](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/index.html).



### Live Activities

  1. [Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual-d) as our WSL Linux 
     distribution of choice.   In the WSL terminal, execute
     
     `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh`
     
     Mac OS folks can do

     `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`

     When downloaded, everyone can run the script by executing `bash Ana...x86_64.sh`.  (Fill in the file name.)
     This takes some time!  Choose `yes` for all options unless you know better.

  2. Open VS Code.  Does it find Anaconda?

  3. Open Spyder.  Play with arrays and plots.

  4. Open Jupyter.  To work, a browser is needed, so, e.g., `sudo apt install firefox`.  Brief
     survey of Markdown mixed with code.

### Jeremy's Notes

  - Display issues took up lots of time. 
  - Ran into some issues getting Spyder to load properly.
