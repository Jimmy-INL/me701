# Raspberry Pi and PyQt

## Summary

We'll explore installation of PyQt on the Pi and the deployment of
graphical applications. 


## Resources

 - [Building PyQt5 from source](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html#building-and-installing-from-source)

##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will display a working PyQt5 application on a RPi0 via VNC or monitor hookup.


## Learning Plan


### Before Lecture

  This part is important and time consuming (though just for the Pi, not you).  By default, the Pi has 
  both Python 2 and Python 3 installed.  Python 2 is the default, so we need to be careful to use
  Python 3 by using the appropriate names.  The basic directions are summarized as follows:

  ```
  sudo apt-get install qt5-default
  pip3 install PyQt-builder
  pip3 install PyQt5-sip
  sip-install
  ```
