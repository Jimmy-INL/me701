# Overview of Object Oriented Programming (in Python)

## Summary

The major features of object-oriented programming are discussed.  These
are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
A few simple but telling examples will be used to illustrate these ideas.
Subsequent lessons will focus on language (Python) details.


## Resources

The online textbook [Object-Oriented Programming in Python](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io)
is a pretty good resource for Python and, in particular, it provides a suitable
level of supporting information for object-oriented programming.

This [neat article](https://medium.com/@pratiknalage/opps-its-object-oriented-programming-533c39e4668f)
gives a nice overview of programming history and a gentle introduction to
some basic OO concepts.


##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will identify the four features of object-oriented programming
    in various examples.
  - Students will define a first Python class.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


## Learning Plan
