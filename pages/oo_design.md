# OO Design

## Summary

Explore how to take  software specification/requirements documentation and turn it
into possible classes, attributes, and methods.

## Resources

Rebecca Wirfs-Brock, et al. **Designing Object-Oriented Software** (old book, but
nothing quite like it.  language agnostic!)

##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will identify classes, attributes, and methods given a 
    software document.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.
