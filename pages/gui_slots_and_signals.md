# Slots and Signals in PyQt5                                  

## Summary

Slots and signals are the basic way to connect widgets.  Slots are like
the entrance to a widget: we need to go inside to deliver a message.  
Signals are the messages that a widget (or we, the human) send.

## Resources

##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will extend their example programs.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

## Learning Plan

### Before Lecture

  - Skim this overview of [slots and signals](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/signals_slots.html)
  - Clone the [sample code](tbd) for this lesson.  (I hope to have ready the night before!)

### During Lecture

  1. Examine the sample code, which provides a simple application that will demonstrate 
     slots and signals.
  2. Implement the slots and signals.  

### After Lecture
