# Slots and Signals in PyQt5                                  

## Summary

Slots and signals are the basic way to connect widgets.  Slots are like
the entrance to a widget: we need to go inside to deliver a message.  
Signals are the messages that a widget (or we, the human) send.

## Resources


##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will extend their example programs.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

## Learning Plan

### Before Lecture

  - Skim this overview of [slots and signals](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/signals_slots.html)

### During Lecture

  1. Discuss when and when not to use GUIs
  2. Compare batch programming (run-at-once) to the event loop (e.g., `while True look for input`)
  3. Construct the minimal PyQt5 application.
