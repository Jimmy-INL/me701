# Qt Designer and PyQt

## Summary

For some applications, it *may* be easier to sketch out designs using 
a "what you see is what you get" interface like Qt Designer.  Windows,
layouts, widgets, and more can be dragged and dropped, and the starter
code (in C++ or, for us, in Python) is automatically generated.  Of course,
slots and signals are largely left to the user to define (as might be 
expected).
