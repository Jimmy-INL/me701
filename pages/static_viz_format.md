# Static Viz Formatting for Excellence

## Summary

<!--
Short description of the lesson.
-->

Good plots need to be honest and efficient.  This lesson
explores how to create such graphics.


<!--
********* STAGE 1 - DESIRED RESULTS ********************************************
-->

## Learning Outcomes

<!--
      What course goals or outcomes will this lesson address?
-->

 - Students will be able to choose the proper tool.
 - Students will be able to show data graphically in static 
   and dynamic form.


## Essential Questions

<!--
      What question(s) will your students be able to answer by the end of
      instruction?
-->

 - What makes a plot "good?"

## Resources

<!--
      What resources can be made available to your student to support their
      active learning?
      What formats are best suited to complement your course material?
-->

  - [Data-Ink Ratio](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/python-plotting/graphical-heuristics-data-ink-ratio-edward-tufte-qFnP9)
  - [Chart Junk](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/python-plotting/graphical-heuristics-chart-junk-edward-tufte-LCcy7)
  



<!--
********* STAGE 2 - ASSESSMENT EVIDENCE ****************************************
-->

##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will define chartjunk and data-ink.

<!--
********* STAGE 3 - LEARNING PLAN ****************************************
-->


## Learning Plan

<!--
List the steps in chronological order to create a timeline of what
will occur in your lesson.

Consider how each of the components below will be included in your
lesson if applicable:

   - Anticipatory Sets/Hooks
       * How will you introduce the material and capture their attention?
   - Teacher Modeling
       * What instructional content and techniques will be incorporated
         into this lesson?
   - Guided Practice
       * How will you scaffold information for your students?
       * How will collaborative learning be used?
   - Learning Activities
       * How will students actively engage with the material?
       * How will students work towards achievement of the learning outcomes?
   - Independent Practice
       * How will students show evidence of learning?
   - Reflection
       * What have you learned about your teaching and content covered in this unit?
       * What changes or adjustments could you make?
       * What were the strongest features of your unit?
       * What are your overall reflections in the course to this point?
   - Conclusion and Preview
       * What should students take away from this lesson?
       * What will happen next? Why?

### Required Preparation

 - Go over the [Lecture 3](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/Basic_Data_Processing_with_NumPy_and_Matplotlib.html) and [Lecture 4](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/More_on_NumPy_Arrays.html) notes from ME 400 on Matplotlib (and NumPy)
 - Skim the examples at the [Matplotlib Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/index.html)
 - Read this short [article](https://storybydata.medium.com/edward-tufte-data-visualization-pioneer-e70eb3a8e2f0) about Edward Tufte
 - Learn about [colormaps](https://bids.github.io/colormap/) 
 
 
I have to point out this Coursera course: [Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting).  It's basically the course I'm trying to distill into a single module!  Two good videos for *this* lecture are these:
  
  - [Data-Ink Ratio](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/python-plotting/graphical-heuristics-data-ink-ratio-edward-tufte-qFnP9)
  - [Chart Junk](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/python-plotting/graphical-heuristics-chart-junk-edward-tufte-LCcy7)
  
They are super short, so watch them!

### Live Activities

  1. The Spreadsheet case study
  2. A look at RCParams
  3. Two data, colors, and printing in black and white.

### Videos
