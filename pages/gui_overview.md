# Graphical User Interfaces with PyQt5                                                

## Summary

The construction of basic graphical user interfaces with PyQt5 is
discussed.

## Resources

[This website](http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5) has lots of wonderful
example code that is about as good as anything I've seen out there.

We use [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/) for
all GUIs.

Recent books on PyQt5 include:

  - Alan D. Moore, *Mastering GUI Programming with Python*, Packt (2019), ISBN 978-1-78961-290-5

  - Michael Hermann, *Python and Qt: The Best Parts* https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-book

PyQt5 builds on Qt5, for which all the documentation is
available [here](http://www.qt.io).

There are [so many](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pyqt5)
PyQt5 videos out there!

##  Evidence of Student Learning


  - Students will load PyQt5 and execute example code.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

## Learning Plan

### Before Lecture

  - Go over the [First Programs](http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/firstprograms/) in PyQt5
  - Take a look at the main [Qt site](http://www.qt.io).

### During Lecture

  1. Discuss when and when not to use GUIs
  2. Compare batch programming (run-at-once) to the event loop (e.g., `while True look for input`)
  3. Construct the minimal PyQt5 application.

### After Lecture
