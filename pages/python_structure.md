# The Structure of Python Programs                                                      

## Summary

The basic structure of Python code is discussed using conditional
statements (i.e., `if`), loops, and functions to illustrate.

## Resources


[codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is an online resource that gamifies
the code-building experience.  The site emphasizes test-driven development.


##  Evidence of Student Learning

<!--
      How will you assess studentsâ€™ prior knowledge?
      What criteria will be used to assess student performance?
      What evidence will be collected to demonstrate achievement?
      How will students reflect and self-assess their learning?
-->

  - Students will explain what a Python program does (or doesn't) do.
  - Students will produce code to solve simple problems.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

## Learning Plan

### Before Lecture

  - A laptop with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
  - Review lectures 13 and 14 of [Python for Engineers](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/index.html).
  - Sign up for [codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

### During Lecture

  1. Clone [repository](https://github.com/me701/python_example_programs)
     with sample programs that illustrate fundamental structures.
  2. Provide 2 to 3 in-class exercises to build on demonstration programs.
  3. Quick walk through of [codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

### After Lecture

 - [Summary Slides](https://github.com/robertsj/me701/blob/f2020/lectures/TheStructureOfPython.ipynb).

The following are my most recent ME 400 videos on the topics of `if` statements,
loops (`for` and `while`) and functions.  Of course, the total time is long, but
you can use these to fill in any gaps you think you may have.
