# Selected SciPy Applications                                                      

## Summary

SciPy offers way more than we could cover in a single lesson (or even
  several).  Here, a handful of neat applications are reviewed that
  span a wide range of technical areas.


## Resources

The [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) project provides a lot of documentation and
support.

The [SciPy Cookbook](https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/) is a great
resource for copy/paste/adapt/(and cite!) solutions for many problems.

##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.

## Learning Plan

### Before Lecture

  - What sort of nasty numerical (or other) problems, equations, etc., have
    you had to solve in a course?  

### During Lecture

  1. Describe big picture of SciPy and list various tools
  2. special functions
  3. integration
  4. image processing
  5. optimization

### After Lecture

 - [Lecture, F2019](https://mediasite.k-state.edu/Mediasite/MyMediasite/presentations/6d35d71b20a24967b698ccb0e0cf11501d),
   [slides](http://localhost:8890/notebooks/SelectedSciPyExamples.ipynb),
   and [supplementary notes](https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/95043/files/14392369/download?download_frd=1).


### Jeremy's Notes 

 This lecture was conducted by Rabab, and the goal was to explore a Jupyter notebook with problems related to numerical errors, linear systems (dense and sparse), and SciPy applications (various curve fits and solving an ODE).  This notebook is homework 4.
