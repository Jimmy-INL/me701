# Test-Driven Development

## Summary

Organizing Python code in functions and files leads to importable *modules* that help
us to glue together more complex programs.  


## Resources

A good overview of how test-driven development has impacted scientific computing
is given by
[Test-Driven Development in HPC Science: A Case Study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8452053)


##  Evidence of Student Learning

  - Students will clone a sample repository with a predefined module.
  - Students will write unit tests.
  - Students will reflect on their learning by completing their daily log.


## Learning Plan

### Before Lecture

  - Review all of the material specified for `The Structure of Python Programs` (our last lesson).  Although I didn't cover this material explicitly in our lessons, the content is thoroughly presented in several videos I've used for ME 400.  I *assume* it's mostly review, but please let me know if anything I cover is way beyond what you saw in your ME 400 experience.

  - Read [Unit Tests and Defensive Programming](https://robertsj.github.io/me400_notes/lectures/Unit_Tests_and_Defensive_Programming.html).
  - Skim [Test-Driven Development in HPC Science: A Case Study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8452053).
  - Execute `conda install pytest` in the terminal.


### During Lecture

  1. Describe what test-driven development is.
  2. Clone example repository.
  3. Examine the module.
  4. Develop unit tests for a simple function.

### After Lecture
